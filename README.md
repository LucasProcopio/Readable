## React Discussion board

    React Discussion Board is a discussion forum web app, for Udacityâ€™s React Nanodegree second project "Readable".
    Users are able to post content to predefined categories, edit, delete, comment on their posts and other users' posts and vote on posts and comments.

    Most application state(Create, Read, Edit, Delete, Voting posts/comments) is managed by the Redux store. Updates are triggered by dispatching actions to reducers.
